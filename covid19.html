		<h1>2021 Festivities Altered Due To COVID-19</h1>
	</div>
	<p>After initially canceling all festivities, we have decided to hold the fireworks show. The display will take place on Friday, July 2nd with spectating from the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tri1iXUChRa67vnV6" target="_blank">Bristol Rec Fields</a>. The fireworks will begin at dusk, likely around 9:45pm - show up early! Vendors will be on hand and parking will be provided by the Masons.</p>

	<p>Additionally, we will host our annual chicken BBQ fundraiser on Wednesday, June 23. Visit <a href="/support/chickenbbq.html">the Chicken BBQ page</a> for more information and thank you in advance for your support!</p>

	<p>See you soon!</p>

		<h1>2021 Festivities Canceled Due To COVID-19</h1>
	</div>
	<p>The 4th of July Committee has voted to cancel the Fireworks and Parade Festivities again this year due to the uncertainty of the Covid-19 situation. One of our members said it best:</p>

	<p>"The realistic part of me says it's not a smart thing to do. It's just a little too soon to hold an event with such a large crowd. We would have to rely on folks to follow the protocols and I'm just not optimistic about that happening. Personally, I would not want to be on the park for any part of the day, except for clean up when it's just us. My vote is to be better safe rather than sorry and wait one more year."</p>

	<p>This was not a unanimous decision and there were several alternative plans considered, but in the end we decided we needed to get the COVID-19 behind us.</p>

	<p>We look forward to seeing you on July 3rd and 4th, 2022!</p>
